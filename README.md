# Pokemon Battle Analysis and Counter-Strategy Database

Our database project is centered around the Pokemon video games, which is a role playing game where players navigate through a virtual world collecting Pokemon and battling other non-player characters.

We developed an SQL database for storing information related to Pokemon battle performance, including specific Pokemon and their attributes, and different moves and abilities that can be used in battles.

The goal of our database is to allow the user to effectively analyze strategies for winning battles against other trainers. By storing a database of information about individual Pokémon, the user easily identify weaknesses in his opponents Pokémon while capitalizing on his own Pokémon’s strengths.
